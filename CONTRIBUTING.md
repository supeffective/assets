This project is a monorepo using turbo and pnpm workspaces. We use Node v18. The package manager used to install

```

Then, use the Quick Start guide found in the [README](README.md) to install dependencies and start the dev server.

The main package can be found in `packages/website`. You can quickly test and debug your
changes by running:

We use `jest` to run tests. You can run all tests with:
