## How to update

- Remove the `masters-icons` folder
- Download the "Master Characters" folder from Lewtwo's Pokémon Asset Archive.
- Create a new folder called `masters-icons` and place the PNGs from the "Master Characters" folder,
ending with " Icon.png", except those that have "Unused" or "HM Icon" in their name.
- Run `node utils/update-trainer-sprites.cjs` to rename them and generate the JSON data file.
